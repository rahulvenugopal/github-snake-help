I came across this awesome `Readme` game

#### My first attempt to replicate this on my readme was a failure and I stumbled upon [eggnaut's](https://github.com/Platane/snk/issues/63) issue page and decided to write a small help repo

1. Goto the readme repo (name of this repo would be same as your username). Click on `Actions` and then `New workflow`

2. Now `Set up a workflow yourself`

3. You will see a .yml file opened and copy-paste the content from this [link](https://github.com/Platane/Platane/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml#L24-L29) and save/commit

4. If everything works well, you should see this

5. The above committ, results in creating a new branch and inside that two .svg files

6. Now, got to the `Readme.md` and add the svg image location, so that the snake animation goes live

7. Have a look at my [Readme](https://github.com/rahulvenugopal/rahulvenugopal) where the snake is having a gala time :dart:

8. You can customise the animation. For example, to change the color of the snake or the grid itself by refering to documentation from original repo
